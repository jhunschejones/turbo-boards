Right now this is just a toy app I built using stimulus.js to create a kanban-board-style, drag-and-drop web app. The initial interface displays tasks as cards and executes database updates for drag-and-drop priority changes within a column, moving tasks across columns, and re-ordering columns themselves.

In the future I may turn this into a more fully featured planning app for my video production work, but I wanted to test this drag-and-drop behavior first to see how doable it is without a massive amount of JS.
